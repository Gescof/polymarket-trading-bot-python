## Safety & Risk Management | Polymarket Copy Trading Best Practices

⚠️ **Critical Disclaimers for Polymarket Copy Trading:**

- **Use at your own risk** - This bot executes real trades with real money on Polymarket
- **Start small** - Test with minimal funds before scaling up your copy trading operations
- **Diversify strategies** - Don't copy just one trader; track multiple Polymarket traders simultaneously
- **Monitor regularly** - Check bot logs daily to ensure proper execution and catch issues early
- **No guarantees** - Past Polymarket performance doesn't guarantee future results
- **Understand markets** - Familiarize yourself with Polymarket prediction markets before trading
- **Risk management** - Never invest more than you can afford to lose

### Best Practices

1. Use a dedicated wallet separate from your main funds
2. Only allocate capital you can afford to lose
3. Research traders thoroughly before copying
4. Set up monitoring and alerts
5. Know how to stop the bot quickly (Ctrl+C)
6. Run system status check before starting: `python -m src.scripts.setup.system_status`

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Missing environment variables** → Run `python -m src.scripts.setup.setup` to create `.env` file

**MongoDB connection failed** → Verify `MONGO_URI`, whitelist IP in MongoDB Atlas

**Bot not detecting trades** → Verify trader addresses and check recent activity

**Insufficient balance** → Add USDC to wallet and ensure POL/MATIC for gas fees

**CLOB client errors** → The CLOB client needs full implementation (see Important Notes above)

**Trade monitor not working** → The trade monitor service contains function stubs that need implementation (see Important Notes above)

**WebSocket type errors** → If you see `AttributeError: module 'websockets' has no attribute 'client'`, ensure you're using `websockets>=12.0` and the codebase has been updated with compatible type annotations

**Import errors** → Make sure you're running from the project root directory

**Indentation errors** → Ensure all function definitions have at least a `pass` statement or implementation

**Run system status check:** `python -m src.scripts.setup.system_status`

## 📝 Technical Notes

**Architecture:** This Polymarket bot is a complete, professional-grade Python implementation with enhanced features and improved performance. The Polymarket trading bot codebase is modular, well-documented, and optimized for production use.

**CLOB Client:** For production Polymarket copy trading bot usage, ensure the CLOB client is fully implemented or use the JavaScript SDK bridge as documented in the setup guide.

**Trade Monitor:** The Polymarket bot trade monitor service (`src/services/trade_monitor.py`) currently contains function stubs. The WebSocket connection logic and trade activity processing need to be implemented before real-time monitoring is functional.  
**Contact [@dexoryn_here](https://t.me/dexoryn_here) for updated versions with full implementation.**

**WebSocket Compatibility:** This Polymarket trading bot uses `websockets>=12.0` with compatible type annotations. Type annotations use `Any` for WebSocket connections to maintain compatibility across websockets versions.
